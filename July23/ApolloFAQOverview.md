# Article Authoring Guidelines & Best Practices - The Apollo Playbook

## Overview

The Apollo playbook provides the resources to help you learn how to create the optimal customer experience when you write your support articles. 

The playbook provides [authoring best practices](https://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/playbook/ApolloBestPractices.html) and [authoring guidelines](#authoring-guidelines) for writing style & strategy, formatting, branding, and accessibility in alignment with the Microsoft Style Guide. The authoring guidelines also provide tips for working with Markdown and support for new authors learning about the Elixir&rarr;GitHub&rarr;Portal publishing experience.


Apollo articles are part of the Solution 2.0 initiative. Learn more at [Solution 2.0 Overview](https://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/elixir/articles/Solutions2Overview.html).


## What is an Apollo article?

Apollo is an insightful, powerful, self-help experience for our customers and support engineers.â€¯By introducing a single, customizable canvas, Apollo lets you create a solution that specifically targets the customer's issue and expedites the troubleshooting experience.

Apollo is a single solution that encompasses all solution types under one canvas, so that you don't need to author diagnostics in a separate config tool.

Apollo lets you combine text, images, diagnostics, charts, videos, and relevant data to build experiences that truly help customers to solve the issue themselves.

Apollo solutions are displayed by two specific user actions in the Azure portal:
- When the user selects Diagnose and Solve under the context of a resource
- When the user selects a support topic in step 2 of the case submission workflow

### To author an Apollo solution:

<ol>
<li>Start at <a href="https://elixir.microsoft.com/solutions/apollosolutions?supportscope=4e65a864-3a49-0120-c059-f7310570b8dc"><strong>Elixir</strong>&rarr;<strong>Solution management</strong>&rarr;<strong>Apollo solutions</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Create a new Apollo article, or copy from an existing article in the list.</li>
<li>Fill out the metadata and the content using our <a href="#authoring-guidelines">authoring guidelines</a> and <a href="https://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/playbook/ApolloBestPractices.html">best practices</a>.
    <ul>
    <li>Add rich solutions to your Apollo article</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Copy and paste from templates.</li>
        <li>Use <strong>Add solution</strong> to automatically build solution components.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
<li>Preview your article before submitting for editorial review.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Rich components can be previewed in the portal after the article is submitted for review.</li>
    </ul>
<li>The review team works with a 2-day SLA, but often publish or return an article for correction sooner than 2 days. After some time has passed, check on your article's status in Elixir to see if it was published or needs corrections.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>The editors may send a request for corrections if your article doesn't meet the <a href="https://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/playbook/ApolloMinRequirementsList.html">Apollo minimum requirements</a>.</li>
    <li>You may have to correct the article numerous times until it meets the minimum requirements to be published.</li>
    </ul>
<li>After an article is published, the status will change on the table in Elixir.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Track the article's SHS rate and adjust as needed based on Bonsai recommendations or the guidance of <a href="ttps://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/playbook/articles/BestPractices.html">best practices</a>.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


## Validation rules and checklist

To ensure that your self-help articles meet validation rules in Elixir and the Microsoft style guidelines:
<ul><li>Use the latest <a href="https://github.com/Azure/SelfHelpContent/blob/master/documents/SelfHelp-Solution-template/apollo-markdown-template.md">Apollo template</a>.</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/elixir/articles/Rules.html"><strong>Validation rules and checklist</strong></a>.</li>
    <ul><li>The <strong>Validation rules and checklist</strong> is a summary of some of the most important aspects of the <a href="#authoring-guidelines">Authoring guidelines</a> in the Apollo playbook. Review the subpages of this playbook for more details and examples.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong></li>
        <ul><li>Use contractions (Use <strong>don't</strong> instead of <strong>do not</strong>; <strong>you'll</strong> instead of <strong>you will</strong>).</li>
        <li>Bold all UI elements. Don't overuse bold in text.</li>
        <li>Enclose error messages in text in quotation marks</li>
        <li>Articles must meet the <a href="https://azsupportdocs.azurewebsites.net/playbook/ApolloMinRequirementsList.html">Apollo minimum requirements</a> or they will be rejected by the review team.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
</ul>
