# Solution types and structure

## Solution types
A successful troubleshooting solution provides context and insights not already
known to the customer. Context and evidence about what the issue was and where
it occurred reduces time spent figuring out the problem.

### Issue-based solutions

Presents an issue with a solution, an issue with multiple solutions, or multiple
issues and solutions. 
- State the issue directly. 
- If the solution covers a range of related issues, you can also illustrate issues through diagnostics. 
- List solutions in priority with the first being the most likely to resolve the problem.

### How-to or conceptual articles

This solution has procedures and/or conceptual information to increase the
user's skill or knowledge for a specific issue or topic. Include information
that customers frequently request.

## Solution structure

Apollo solutions are clear steps that can be scanned and understood quickly.
Users don’t have a lot of time to read and figure out a solution. Users
troubleshoot for 5 to 20 minutes before submitting a ticket. They will continue
to try and solve the issue on their own as they wait for contact from support.

-   Ensure your solution has headers or sections to guide the user
-   A clear solution title and description of the problem
-   A clear description and section titles
-   If warranted, use diagnostics, charts, videos, Azure KB, etc.
-   Structure long text in a table (issues, errors, tools, and their related solutions)
-   More than 5 links is overwhelming to the reader

### Title and introduction

For the title, the H2 (##) header, use a descriptive problem statement that starts with an action verb and targets the issue. Keep the title as succinct as possible.

Examples of great action verbs to start a title:
- Resolve
- Configure
- Troubleshoot

After your H2 title, write a brief introduction of what the customer will learn about or learn how to perform (for example, resolve an error) in the article.
