# Editorial process

**Page owner:** [Laxmi Peketi](sree.peketi@microsoft.com)

There is a two-business-day service level agreement (SLA). 

Generally, articles are reviewed within 24 hours or less after it’s been in the queue for editors to
review. 

- The two-day SLA is for the team to review the PR and provide comments, not to merge and publish the PR. After the review, you may be required to make changes.
- How quickly you address the comments in the PR will impact the time to merge and
publish the documents. 
- If your PR hasn’t been merged within the expected timeframe, check to see if it has been sent back for correction. If not, reach
out to the editors by 
  - Using the <strong>@ACPTeam</strong> tag on any of these Teams support channels:
    - [Azure Customer Support Fundamentals: General channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2a65bc409e904a9c849bc5705fb51f3a%40thread.skype/General?groupId=7fffae01-de0e-4203-9bc1-13df21989c35&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47)

  - Directly contacting them:
    - The name/alias of the editor assigned to your PR can be found on the <strong>Conversation</strong> tab of your PR in GitHub. 
    - You may also find the editor's alias on a comment added to your PR's file on the <strong>Files changed</strong> tab of your PR on GitHub.
