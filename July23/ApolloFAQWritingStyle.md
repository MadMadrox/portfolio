# Writing strategy and style

Strategy and style present a solution with clear, concise content in a friendly, dynamic voice that engages the customer, while also meeting Microsoft style standards.

- Use sentence case for headings. 
  - **For example**: \#\#\# Learn how to configure settings in Cosmos DB
- Where feasible, use "select", not "click". 
  - "Select" applies across all devices, whereas "click" should only be used for actions related to using a mouse.
- Don't use "please". You're providing information to a user seeking help, so "please" isn't necessary.
- Don't use Latin abbreviations or words. Avoid common Latin abbreviations (e.g., i.e.,). Instead, use "for example". Also, avoid Latin words such as *via* and *verbatim*.

## Table of contents

- [Tone](#tone)
- [Active voice and verbs](#active-voice-and-verbs)
- [Verb tense](#verb-tense)


## An article consisting of only links and no body of content

If the link or article provides the customer with sufficient and complete
information, then it’s probably OK. 
- Be sure to provide context in the article about the information the customer will find in the link, article, or video instead of ONLY providing a link.
- Providing a link or links as the only content in your article looks incredibly lazy.
- It's okay if this is all the information you can provide as long as you provide context in your content (and not just a link dump).

## Tone

We want our customers to feel that they've reached a friendly expert. Strategies include using positive phrasing as much as possible and using contractions instead of spelled-out verb phrases.

***Example of contractions in verb phrases***:

**Our style**: If you *don't* confirm that *you've* received the message, you *won't* be able to proceed.  
**Not our style**: If you *do not* confirm that *you have* received the message, you *will not* be able to proceed.

### Contractions to focus on

Focus mainly on -n't contractions, such as: 
- isn't 
- don't
- won't
- haven't
- can't

### Contractions you should avoid

**Avoid "is" contractions**

Avoid contracting the verb "is", which can be harder to read.
- For example, avoid situations like this: “The browser's fast, simple, and secure."  

**Avoid double contractions**

Also avoid double contractions like, "You *mightn't* have...". 
- Instead, spell it out: "You *might not* have...".

## Active voice and verbs

Use active voice and active verbs rather than a passive voice and passive verbs. Active voice and verbs produce more concise sentences. Equally important, they directly engage the customer as the active agent ("you," either explicitly or implicitly).

**Our style**: You query the service, and the server sends an acknowledgment.  
**Not our style**: The service is queried, and an acknowledgment is sent.

- ***To de-emphasize the subject or the actor***:<br>
  - **Example:** Over 50 conflicts were found in the file.

- ***If the customer doesn't need to know who or what is responsible for the action***:<br>
  - **Example**: The database was purged in January.

### Imperative verbs
Use imperative verbs—direct commands to the user—whenever possible, omitting extra words. This is the most concise verb form, and it also directly engages the customer.

**Our style**: "Run the following command."  
**Not our style**: "You can run the following command" OR "The following command is run."

## Verb tense

Use present tense, except where past or future tense is necessary. Consistent present tense is easier to read and less confusing than verb tense that shifts between present, past, and future. Try to avoid "will."

**Our style**: Send a query to the service. The server sends an acknowledgment.<br>
**Not our style**: If you send a query to the service, the server will send an acknowledgment.  

Try to avoid the hypothetical "would" which sounds less definite than present tense.

**Our style:** If you send an unsubscribe message, the server removes you from the mailing list.<br>
**Not our style**: If you send an unsubscribe message, the server would then remove you from the mailing list.
