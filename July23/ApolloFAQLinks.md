# Working with links

Follow these guidelines when working with links in your articles:
* In general, use the title of the article for your link text. 
* Do not use [*Here*], [*this article*], [*follow these steps*], etc. 
* Use descriptive link text to help ensure the content meets Microsoft Accessibility standards. If the article is outside Microsoft, such as Stack Overflow, use the full title of the site.

***Example of concise phrasing:***

**Our style:** "For more information, see [*Azure Active Directory is your friend*]."  
**Not our style**: "If you would like more information, refer to [*this article*]."

***Examples of extended phrasing:***  

- "Learn more about [*Azure Kubernetes Service*]."  
- "To create a site-to-site VPN gateway connection in the Azure portal, see [*link
text*]."

## Authoring an article with only one link to an article or video

If the link or article provides the customer with sufficient and complete
information, then itâ€™s probably OK. 
- Be sure to provide context in the article about the information the customer will find in the link, article, or video instead of ONLY providing a link.
- Providing a link or links as the only content in your article looks incredibly lazy.
- It's okay if this is all the information you can provide as long as you provide context in your content (and not just a link dump). 

## Use accessible links

Avoid internal links, such as *aka.ms* links or *review.microsoft.docs* links. 
- These links aren't accessible to external users.

## Links in the Resources section

In your **Resources** section, make a long list of resources more scannable by dividing it into categories (if applicable). Remember to use the actual titles of the article, document, or video being linked.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: <span style="color:red">**Important**</span>:
<ul><li>No more than 5 links total and only links not mentioned in the article.
    </li><li>Explanatory phrases added for links only if necessary.
    </li>
</ul>

**Example:**
```
